# My Java and Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my practice repository where I'm honing my skills in Java and Python. This repository serves as a sandbox for me to experiment with code, explore new concepts, and improve my programming proficiency.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains various projects and code snippets written in Java and Python. Each project is designed to tackle specific challenges (mainly from Leetcode), ranging from basic algorithms to more complex problems. 
The code here continually evolves as I strive to improve my understanding and application of these two programming languages.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

My main objectives for this repository are:

1. **Deepen My Understanding of Code:**
   - Explore advanced concepts in both Java and Python.
   - Break down complex problems and develop step-by-step solutions.
   - Analyze different approaches to problem-solving and understand the underlying logic.

2. **Write More Efficient Code:**
   - Focus on optimizing algorithms and reducing time and space complexity.
   - Explore different data structures and their applications to enhance code efficiency.

3. **Implement Unit Testing:**
   - Incorporate unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
   - Learn and apply best practices for writing unit tests in both Java and Python.
   - Use testing frameworks like JUnit (for Java) and `unittest` or `pytest` (for Python) to automate testing and improve code coverage.
